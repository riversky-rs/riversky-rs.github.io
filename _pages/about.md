Profile
======
My name is Cuimi Duo, and I am currently studying Computer Science and Technology at the International College of Zhengzhou University. I have a strong passion for computer science and technology and am excited about its extensive applications in modern society.

During my time at university, I actively participated in various courses and projects, striving to learn and master the core concepts and skills of computer science. I have a solid foundation in programming, algorithm design, and data structures, and I enjoy using coding to solve problems and implement innovative ideas.

In addition to academics, I also focus on developing teamwork and communication skills. I have been involved in multiple team projects, collaborating with classmates to complete challenging tasks. These experiences have not only improved my ability to work in a team but also honed my problem-solving and organizational skills.

In the future, I hope to continue deepening my knowledge and exploring cutting-edge technologies and applications in the field of computer science. I aspire to utilize my talents in areas such as software development, artificial intelligence, or data science and contribute to solving real-world problems.
